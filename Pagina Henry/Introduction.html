        <br><p>Our project is called boatlife and it will be a boat with intelligence which is able to recognize waste and classify it into organic and inorganic. 
        Our mission is to help improve the environment and in this project we focus more on helping marine life using the advances in technology that the world offers us today.</p></br>

        <p>Although ocean water covers more than 70% of the Earth, it is only in recent decades that we have begun to understand how this aquatic habitat is affected by human activity.</p><br></br>

        <p>Studies conducted in recent years show that degradation, especially in coastal areas, has accelerated markedly over the past three centuries as industrial discharges and runoff from farms and coastal cities have increased.</p><br></br>

        <P>The ocean is the source and engine of all life on this planet, and it is under threat.
            A big part of the problem: pollution.</P><br></br>

        <P>How does trash get into the ocean? It's dumped, pumped, spilled, filtered and even washed off our clothes. Every year, we expose the world's waterways to an increasing variety of pollutants: plastic waste, chemicals, crude oil and more.</P><br></br>  
        
        <P>Fortunately, it's not too late to clean up our act. Share the truth about ocean pollution and help make a difference.</P><br></br>

        <p>Why did we decide to carry out the project?
            Human activity has a major impact on the marine environment. Pollutants emitted by industry, agriculture and other similar activities enter the oceans through groundwater, surface water and precipitation, therefore we have decided to carry out this project.</p>
