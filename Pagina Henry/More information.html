       <p>Eight million metric tons: that's the amount of plastic we dump into the oceans every year. Equivalent to almost 57,000 blue whales, every year. By 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean.</p>
   
        <b><h2> Garbage islands</h2></b>

        <p>There is so much trash in the sea that the debris has formed giant garbage patches. There are five of them around the world, and the largest - the Great Pacific Garbage Patch - includes approximately 1.8 trillion pieces of trash and covers an area twice the size of Texas</p>

        <b><h3>Plastic poses a double danger</h3></b>

        <p>Ocean trash can break down into smaller pieces, known as microplastics, from exposure to the sun and wave action, and then find its way into the food chain. When it finally degrades (which takes 400 years for most plastics), the process releases chemicals that further pollute the sea.</p>
